# Short Urls

Shortened URLS can be added inside the `vercel.json` file. To add a short url, [Open the vercel.json](https://github.com/Differential/longhollow-web/edit/main/vercel.json) file for editing. Look for the `redirects` section, and add a new line for your redirct. 

The `source` should be the "short url", and the "destination" should be where the user lands. Once you have made your changes, you might want to [validate your JSON](https://jsonlint.com/) before saving.

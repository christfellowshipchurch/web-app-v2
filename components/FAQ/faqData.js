    Tithing isn’t as much about finances as it is about faith. It’s not about what God wants from you but what He has for you.  <br/><br/>In Malachi 3:10, The Bible says we can test this promise. When we bring our first and best back to God, He promises to bless the rest of our resources so that we could be a blessing toward others.`,

Our offerings go beyond the obedience of the tithe; they are a reflection of a life marked by generosity. We believe generosity has a divine purpose connected to it, which is why we invite our church family to give beyond the tithe in one of these ways throughout the year.

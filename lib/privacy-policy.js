<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
<p>
  We collect personal data when you provide it, both offline and online. You do
  not need to provide personal information to use Christ Fellowship websites and
  services. You can create a profile, which allows us to tailor our sites and
  services to be a more personalized experience. To create a profile, we require
  your first and last name, email address, phone number, and password to
  authenticate you when accessing your profile. Beyond the personal information
  needed to create a profile, you have choices about what additional information
  you provide to us, which may include your zip code, the names of family
  members, gender, and marital status, all of which will be stored in
  association with your profile. Certain information may be required based on
  your specific request, such as your social security number for employment
  inquiries and volunteer requests; we will notify you of this at the time of
  such a request.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  We also collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage in
  communications with us, including when you submit personal information or
  requests by emailing hello@christfellowship.church. We retain those
  communications to process your inquiries, respond to requests, and improve our
  sites and services.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When you interact with us, the information you provide us is generally stored
  internally in our third-party relationship management system, or “CRM system.”
  We will use this information to authenticate you and allow you to access your
  specific profile, when available. We also create user profiles for offline
  purposes, including volunteerism and inquiries concerning employment. We may
  combine the information you provide us for your profile and interactions with
  our websites and mobile apps with the information you provide us through other
  Christ Fellowship sites, services, and products and inferences we make from
  the same for our internal development to improve the overall quality of our
  sites, services, and products. We may also recommend other Christ Fellowship
  services based on the information you provide, and we infer.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Your Posts</h3>
<p>
  Our Christ Fellowship Websites, Mobile apps, and services have a wide array of
  functionality, including streaming video, creating prayer requests, and
  identifying and communicating with your Christ Fellowship groups and teams.
  Some Christ Fellowship Websites, Mobile apps, and services may allow you to
  publish, distribute, and display content to specific inpiduals or the public.
  We will refer to how you provide content and information as “posted” and the
  content and information posted as “user contributions.” User contributions may
  be made on public areas of websites and social media accounts you access
  through our sites or may otherwise be transmitted to third parties. Your user
  contributions are processed by us to facilitate your ability to create, use,
  store, and distribute user contributions as you choose. We will associate your
  user contributions with your account if you opt not to delete them.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you disclose personal information, whether through collaborative postings,
  social media, message boards, or otherwise, this information may be collected
  and used by others. User contributions are posted and transmitted at your own
  risk. We cannot control the actions of other users or third parties with whom
  you choose to share your user contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not
  guarantee that unauthorized persons will not view your user contributions, nor
  do we accept any liability associated with your user contributions.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Giving</h3>
<p>
  If you choose to provide a donation through one of the Christ Fellowship
  Websites, Mobile apps, and services, then and only then will you be prompted
  and required to provide a credit card, bank account, and other financial
  information necessary to process the transaction. We will collect the
  designation for your donation if you provide one and personal information such
  as your name, address, phone number, and/or email address to ensure that your
  donation is used for the purpose you request and to provide you with an annual
  giving statement that itemizes your donation(s). We will also contact you
  periodically to inquire if you would like to give to another program,
  location, or cause. We may contact you through push notifications, SMS, email,
  mail, or in-app messages to share these opportunities.
</p>
<br />

  system. As of the date of this Policy, we use PushPay to process your online

<br />
<h3>Christ Fellowship Merchandise</h3>

  clothing and other items, including our cafe locations, your personal and
  financial information is provided and shared with our third-party contractors,
  who will process your order. The third parties are identified at the time of

  first and last name, telephone number, address, social security number, date
  of birth, and your employment history in the case of a job inquiry. We will
  store and use this information to process your application and associate it
  with your profile if one exists. We will use your social security number and
  date of birth solely for a background check regarding your application to be a
  volunteer and/or employee. We will not share either with any third party
  except for third-party service providers that enable us to perform background
  checks. We are obligated not to share or use your information for any other
  purpose. If you become an employee of Christ Fellowship Church, your personal
  information is also used in connection with your employment.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  As a volunteer, you may have access to third-party software that allows you to
  schedule and check in to your volunteer activity and manage other volunteer
  activities. This location-based information is stored in association with your
  profile to enable you to see your past volunteerism, and we also use it for
  our internal analysis.

  access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform tasks on our
  behalf and are obligated not to disclose it to others or use it for other
  purposes. We may also provide aggregate, de-identified information concerning
  the use of Christ Fellowship Church sites with third parties.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Content Providers</h3>
<p>
  We utilize certain third parties to provide content on our sites. We do not
  share the personal information of users with these third parties. We may
  provide these third parties with aggregate analytics concerning the use of
  their content using de-identified and anonymized data.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Legal Process and Subpoena</h3>
<p>
  We may need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena,
  or other legal process. We attempt to notify users about legal demands for
  their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law
  or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such
  demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad,
  vague, or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every
  demand. We may also need to disclose your information if we have a good faith
  belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    Investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal
    activities or to assist government enforcement agencies;
  </li>
  <li>Enforce our agreements with you;</li>
  <li>
    Investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or
    allegations;
  </li>
  <li>Protect the security or integrity of our sites or</li>
  <li>
    Exercise or protect the rights and safety of Christ Fellowship Church, our
    users, personnel, you, or others. 
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  We also reserve the right to confidentially disclose personal information we
  have about you in connection with a potential or actual merger or acquisition
  such as the sale of all or substantially all our assets.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Deleting, Accessing, and Correcting Your Information</h3>
<br />
<h3>How to Make Your Requests</h3>
<p>For personal data that we have about you, you may request the following:</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Deletion:</b> You may ask us to erase or delete all or some of your
  personal data. Please note that doing so may limit your ability to use certain
  functionality of Christ Fellowship Church sites. Please note that an email
  address is required to have an account to ensure we can properly authenticate
  potential users of that account.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Correction/Modification:</b> You may edit some of your personal data
  through your account or ask us to change, update, or fix your data in certain
  cases, including if it is inaccurate.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data:</b> You can ask us to stop
  using all or some of your personal data or to limit our use of it.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Right to Access and/or Take Your Data: </b>You can ask us for a copy of or
  disclosure concerning your personal data you provided to us.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Certain laws may provide the right to make additional requests concerning your
  personal information. If you have provided us with personal information and
  wish to make such a request under a specific region’s law, include the phrase
  “[Your State/Country] Privacy Request” in the subject line of your request and
  send your request via email to data.privacy@Christfellowship.church or via
  mail to Christ Fellowship Church, attn.: Data Privacy, 5343 Northlake Blvd,
  Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33418.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  We ask that inpiduals making requests identify themselves with at least their
  name, mailing address, and email address and identify the information
  requested to be accessed, corrected, or removed before we process the request.
  We may seek additional information to verify a requestor’s identity. We may
  decline to process requests if we cannot verify the requestor's identity or if
  we believe the request will jeopardize the privacy of others, violate any law
  or legal requirement, cause the information to be incorrect, or for a similar
  legitimate purpose.
</p>
<p>
  We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under
  applicable law. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable
  request concerning your personal information unless it is excessive, unduly
  burdensome, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the
  request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide
  a cost estimate before completing your request.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Deleting Your Account</h3>
<p>
  You can delete your Christ Fellowship Church account credentials at any time
  using the settings function in the Christ Fellowship Church application. To
  request deletion of all account data, you must follow the deletion request
  instructions above; however, when you delete your account, we will delete the
  information associated with your account, such as user contributions you have
  created, received, or shared. If you do not want to delete your account or
  this information but want to temporarily stop using a Christ Fellowship Church
  site, you may cease use, and we will maintain your account and the information
  associated with your account until you resume use or delete your account,
  whichever comes first.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  We generally retain and process information and user contributions associated
  with your account until your account is deleted. You can manage, change, and
  delete certain information associated with your account using the Christ
  Fellowship Church application. If you’d like us to delete your account and all
  the information associated with your account, you may contact us via email to
  data.privacy@Christfellowship.church or via mail to Christ Fellowship Church,
  attn.: Data Privacy, 5343 Northlake Blvd, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33418.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you choose to delete your account or ask that we modify or delete personal
  information, we will delete and purge personal information we have stored
  about you in a way that is electronically irreversible; however, we may retain
  your personal data if we have a legal right or obligation to maintain the
  information or to meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain
  security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our rights, or fulfill any other
  requests from you (for example, to opt-out of further messages or for a copy
  of your data). Otherwise, if you request that we delete your account, we will
  delete your account and all the information we have that is associated with
  your account, except for aggregated statistics based on de-identified
  information and inferences we have made (for example, the fact that you
  downloaded our application, without identifying you or maintaining personal
  information associated with that account).
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Our deletion of your information and account will generally take up to 45 days
  from your request; however, cached information may take up to 30 days to
  delete. Please note that we have no control of the information you have shared
  with others through our sites and applications after you close your account,
  ask to delete information, or attempt to delete your account yourself. Your
  information and content you have shared may continue to be displayed in the
  services of others, including search engine results, until their cache
  refreshes.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Security and Protection</h3>
<p>
  We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data. These include
  using encryption for your data while being transmitted between your device or
  browser and our servers and while at rest. Data provided to us through our
  sites is also stored in an ISO 27017-certified infrastructure management
  system, meaning it has been audited and found in compliance with the
  requirements of the management system standards ISO 27017, an internationally
  recognized code of practice for information security controls for cloud
  services. However, given the nature of communications and information
  technology and that the use of the internet has inherent risks, although we
  regularly monitor for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, we cannot warrant
  or guarantee that information provided to us through our sites or stored in
  our systems or otherwise will be free from unauthorized intrusion by others,
  nor can we warrant or guarantee that such data may not be accessed, disclosed,
  altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or
  managerial safeguards.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Children</h3>
<p>
  We do not collect personal information from any person we know is under 13
  without the consent of that minor’s parent or legal guardian.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A parent or guardian may consent to use our sites or services by a minor.
  However, we ask that you discuss the risks of sharing personal information on
  the Internet with your children and require that they refrain from
  communicating with any third parties or sharing any personal information
  online or otherwise without the supervision of a parent or guardian. Should
  you allow your minor child to use our sites or services, you are solely
  responsible for supervising the minor’s use of the same and assume full
  responsibility for the processing of any information provided to us by that
  minor.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Where you associate your minor child’s information with your account, we will
  assume you consent to our processing of that information in accordance with
  this policy and other privacy notices and terms we may provide to you from
  time to time. If you allow your minor child to use our sites, we ask that you
  discuss the risks of sharing personal information on the Internet with your
  children and require that they refrain from communicating with any third
  parties or sharing any personal information with other users. If you believe
  we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact
  us at data.privacy@Christfellowship.church.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Processing of Data</h3>
<p>
  We will only collect and process your personal data where we have lawful
  bases. Lawful bases include consent where you have given it, contracts, and
  other legitimate interests. Such legitimate interests include protection to
  you, us, other users, and third parties, to comply with applicable law, to
  enable and administer our internal processes, to manage corporate
  transactions, to generally understand and improve our internal processes and
  user experience, and to enable us and other users of our sites to connect with
  you to exchange information, provided that the preceding adequately protects
  your rights and freedoms. Where we rely on your consent to process personal
  data, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time, and
  where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object. If you
  have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use your
  personal data, please contact us via email at
  data.privacy@Christfellowship.church or via mail to Christ Fellowship Church,
  attn.: Data Privacy, 5343 Northlake Blvd, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33418.

<h3>Third-Party Information Collection</h3>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy applies only to sites and apps owned and operated by
  Christ Fellowship Church. Our sites may contain links to other websites or
  apps. You are responsible for reviewing the privacy statements and policies of
  those other websites you choose to link to or from one of our sites so that
  you can understand how those websites collect, use, and store your
  information. We are not responsible for the privacy statements, policies or
  content of other websites or apps, including websites you link to or from a
  Christ Fellowship Church site. Websites containing co-branding (referencing
  our name and a third party’s name) contain content delivered by the third
  party, not us.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If you link to other websites, applications, and services or profiles you have
  with third-party applications, you will provide the personal data stored on
  those applications to Christ Fellowship Church. For example, you may link your
  Facebook account to your profile, providing personal information you have
  opted to share through Facebook to Christ Fellowship Church. When you do so,
  we are provided with your Facebook or other applicable social media username.
  You may revoke the link with such accounts and third-party applications by
  modifying your settings with those applications. As noted above, third-party
  sites that link to or are associated with our sites may collect information
  using automated technologies such as cookies. We have no control over such
  collection and use, which are subject to the privacy policies of those third
  parties.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Users Outside the United States</h3>
<p>
  We are based in Florida within the United States, and the laws of the U.S. and
  the State of Florida govern your use of our sites and this Privacy Policy. If
  you are using one of our sites from outside this state or country, your
  information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the U.S. where our
  servers are located, and our central database is operated. We process data
  both inside and outside of the U.S. and rely on contractual commitments
  between us and companies transferring personal data that require the
  protection and security of such data for your privacy. The data protection and
  other laws of the State of Florida, the U.S., and other countries might not be
  as comprehensive and may differ from those in your state or country. By using
  a Christ Fellowship Church site, you consent to your information being
  transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties
  with whom we share it, as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and your continued use of
  Christ Fellowship sites after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of
  those changes. So, please check this policy periodically for updates. Our
  policy is to post any changes we make to our Privacy Policy on this page. If
  we make material changes to how we treat our users’ Personal Information, we
  will notify you by e-mail (if you have an email address on record with us) and
  through a notice on the website home pages. The date the Privacy Policy was
  last revised is identified at the top of the page.
